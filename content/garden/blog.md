Hello, and welcome.

My name is Ben, nice to meet you. 

I guess I'll talk about myself for a second to set the scene. At the time of writing, I'm 26 and living in Brisbane, Australia. I work professionally as a Front End Software Engineer, which means I make user  interfaces. I don't really like boxing myself in like that though, I also do a bunch of other stuff:

- I make independent video games with my best friend at [TwoPM Studios](https://twopm.studio)
- I make curated Spotify playlists at [Soundtrack To My Life](https://soundtracktomy.life)
- I take photos, you can see those on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bfoll69/)

I also have a lot of interests I don't get to talk about as much as I'd like:

- Physics
- Art, of almost any kind
- Music
- Travel
- Biology
- Love & relationships
- Storytelling
- Philosophy
- Health & fitness
- Self-optimization
- Technology
- Fashion

I'm not showing off, I probably *sound* like an asshole but, uh, whatever? Hopefully by the end of this article you'll feel differently. The main result of doing different projects and having a lot of interests is... I'm really busy. That's not a complaint, I like being busy and I do not equate being busy with stress *at all*. So, why am I adding a writing project to the list? There are a few reasons.

1. It lets me focus on interests that I can't express through my work
2. I can formalise and refine my understanding and beliefs by putting them into words
3. I want to share the lessons I've learned and those I will continue to learn

The last one is my main motivation. I *think* I present a perspective that isn't all that common. I've spent a lot of time not being especially happy in my life and have been left very unsatisfied by the conventional answers to many of my questions. I've actually had a very privileged life, my largest obstacle has been my relationship with my own mind. I struggle with depression, anxiety, feeling like an outcast, creative doubt and societal expectations. Like most who face these challenges, you probably wouldn't know it from talking to me. I *also* struggle with sharing my emotions, both out of fear of judgement and fear of burdening others.

I laugh **a lot** and I'm usually smiling. I get lost in my imagination and spend hours staring at the ceiling, listening to music. I've been told I'm too sensitive *and* that I'm robotically cold and calculating. I care deeply about other people but have trouble showing it.

That paints a pretty bleak picture, I know I've got some issues. *But* I have made a lot of headway on all these fronts. Obviously the battle is never won but I think the insights I've gained are worth sharing. 

> My goal, not just in writing but in life, is to give others a sense of understanding about their insecurities and trauma, ultimately helping them to accept themselves and find contentment. I want to write the words my younger self needed to hear.

I’m dedicated to creating a life I love and one that younger self would be proud of. I may rehash ideas from others, accidentally or otherwise, but presenting them in my voice and from my context *may* give them new significance to some people. That's all the reason I need.

I still don't know *exactly* what content you can expect here, it could range from self-help to supplementation guides to programming tutorials. If you think you sound anything like me, or even if you don't, maybe we can learn something.

I do have one ulterior motive, by sharing the lessons I have learned and will continue to learn I hope to treat writing as some form of therapy. I want to keep pushing myself to share more and more of my insecurities so that I can, in turn, accept them and be happier for it.
