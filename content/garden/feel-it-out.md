# Feeling it out

When I find myself in a negative mood the natural tendency is to try and _get out_ as fast as possible. And so; I seek distraction. I read, I overthink, I spiral down seemingly informative youtube blackholes. Or, I seek a remedy. I obsess over productivity, exercise, and health. Where has my motivation gone? What do I need to do to bring it back?

None of this is _technically wrong_ but every activity can be a form of _doing_ to avoid simply _being_. Meditating for the sake of meditating is useless when it comes to accepting your feelings. More broadly, discipline and willpower are blunt tools for emotional turmoil. 

So, this is a reminder to _feel it out_. Sit with how you feel, let it wash over you and you might actually get some clarity on what your mind is trying to tell you... Or you might not, but you'll have to accept that the only way out is through.
