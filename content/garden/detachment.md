> Does spirituality encourage detachment from the world?

Spirituality encourages neither attachment nor detachment. Spirituality encourages nothing, it merely asks one to look for the world as it is. 

This question typically comes from a place of concern for a spiritual skeptic. They fear that adopting the non-dual perspective will somehow sever their connection to all that they hold dear. In fairness, it will certainly affect one's relationship to their attachments. Tugging once on the string of inquiry may leave you feeling detached, but tug a little further and you will find there was nothing to be attached to in the first place.

Tug a little further again and you will find the string disappears altogether.
